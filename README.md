# Capstone

This project is a representation of what we have learned throughout our courses in GCU and showing the results for it. Specifically, for our bachelor's degrees in Computer Science with an Emphasis in Game and Simulation Development in mind, we thought it would be best to make a game as our final product. 

# Description

Star Shooter is a top-down sci-fi shooter game with pixel art that offers gamers round-based challenges. The player must fight through endless waves of enemies, upgrading weapons to achieve a new high score. A loadout of standard weapons can temporarily be enhanced by collecting a power-up for special weapons. Boss enemies will appear at breakpoint rounds as a sign that the difficulty is about to ramp up.
