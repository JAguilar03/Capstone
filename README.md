# Capstone

This project is a representation of what we have learned throughout our courses in GCU and showing the results for it. Specifically, for our bachelor's degrees in Computer Science with an Emphasis in Game and Simulation Development in mind, we thought it would be best to make a game as our final product. 

# Description

Star Shooter is a top-down sci-fi shooter game with pixel art that offers gamers round-based challenges. The player must fight through endless waves of enemies, upgrading weapons to achieve a new high score. A loadout of standard weapons can temporarily be enhanced by collecting a power-up for special weapons. Boss enemies will appear at breakpoint rounds as a sign that the difficulty is about to ramp up. 

# TO DO:

Improve on game now that basic prototype is complete, this includes but is not limited to:
- Advanced Difficulty Scaling
- More Enemy Types
- Multiplayer support
- More weapon types

# How to Play Star Shooter

There is a Google Drive link found in the GameBuildLink.txt file that needs to be copied and pasted into the search bar. From there, Google will open up on the browser and the file will need to be downloaded through the website. After downloading the file, it will need to be extracted, to do this for Windows, locate and click on the downloaded zip file. Now that the file is highlighted, right-click and select Extract All on the pop-up window. Once the file is extracted, open the new file. Inside the GameBuild file, search for the Top-Down-Shooter-Capstone Application file, and run that file by double-clicking it. From there, Star Shooter should then launch and the start screen for the game shoud load.
